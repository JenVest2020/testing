          <h3>2004:</h3>A broken heart is a searching heart.<br>
          After the dissolution of my first marriage, a friend, knowing I was
          becoming depressed, gifted to me a digital art software cd-rom that
          she no longer used. She encouraged me to just play around with it and
          claimed this new hobby was a great therapeutic tool as well. I can no
          longer remember the name of the software. Only that it did, indeed,
          become a very effective therapeutic tool for me. I would spend hours
          exploring all of it’s special effect plug-ins and create small design
          pieces I thought were quite beautiful and pleasing for me to look at.
          I’ve always loved art but lacked the talent and skill to make my hands
          create the designs in my mind. To me, this software was revolutionary
          and I was hooked.
